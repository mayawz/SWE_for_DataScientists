    "- what is good code\n",
    ">- simplicity - don't repeat yourself; all knowledge should have one single representation in code; drop unnecessary complexity or unneeded lines\n",
    ">- modularity - code skeleton, functions \n",
    ">- readability - adhering to standards and conventions for your programming language, choosing good names, removing unused code, and writing documentation for your code, \n",
    ">- performance - runtime and memory, \n",
    ">- robustness - reproducible; run without failure + responds to changes gracefully; properly handling errors, logging what has happened, and writing good tests; testing (user testing & automated testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "- tech debt\n",
    ">- for deferred work resulting from when code is written quickly instead of correctly. missing documentation, poorly structured code, poorly named variables, or any other cut corners. although, it's often necessary because of business deadlines and budgets\n",
